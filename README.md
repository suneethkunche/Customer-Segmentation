The primary goal of this project is to boost sales by offering discount coupons to a targeted group of customers who exhibit lower spending behavior. This is accomplished through customer segmentation using data visualization techniques and K-means clustering. Effective customer segmentation allows businesses to enhance their marketing strategies by tailoring offers to specific groups.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction because it transforms the original features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components that capture the most variance in the data. This helps in retaining the most informative aspects of the dataset while reducing noise and redundancy. As a result, PCA improves the quality of clustering by ensuring that only the most significant underlying patterns influence the segmentation results, leading to more meaningful and interpretable customer groups.
The Elbow Method in K-Means is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The "elbow" point on the graph—where the rate of decrease sharply slows—indicates the ideal number of clusters. This helps avoid overfitting or under fitting in clustering.
K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. It assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and iteratively updates the centroids to minimize the within-cluster variance. The process continues until the centroids stabilize. It’s widely used for customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and data compression.
Using the Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle, the project applies K-means clustering to categorize customers based on their annual income and spending habits. The process begins with data pre-processing, including managing missing data and standardizing features. Lasso regression is utilized for feature selection to retain only the most impactful variables for clustering.
The Elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate segmentation. A key focus is on identifying customers with high income but low spending. For these customers, a targeted coupon or discount strategy is proposed to incentivize greater purchasing behaviour and improve overall sales performance.
